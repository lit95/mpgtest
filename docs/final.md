### Information Problem 
Lack of awareness about minority-owned business in the Prince George’s County area. 

### Identified Stakeholders/Target Browsers
Main stakeholders are residents and patrons of of the PG County area.
Other stakeholders are PG County citizens, companies, retailers, researchers, and anyone else who is interested in PG county data.

### Data
Data used comes from Maryland.gov's Open Data

### Chosen Strategies and Solutions
Our solution was to develop a web application that allows users to search for restaurants in PG county. The application will provide a search interface to locate categories of businesses (e.g. restaurant, consulting services, mechanic shop) relevant to the users’ needs. The application will also allow users to peruse the result set in both a list form and a map that plots the locations of each business in the result set. 

### Technical System Decision Rationale
We selected this API as our team feels that is it optimal for displaying information on these local businesses, is juxtaposed well within the realm of our topic, and aligns closely with our objectives for the application. With the use of this API, our team hopes to surmount our information problem of local business consciousness, to create a well fleshed-out application using data we retrieve from this API. To meet our users’ information need of discovering and increasing engagement with local minority-owned businesses, we felt it would be necessary to incorporate an API that would encourage both. A map that could not only help users find local businesses but also provide directions for how to travel to them would therefore be an excellent way to facilitate both aims simultaneously.

### How System Addresses the Problem

### Challenge and Impact on Final Design

### Possible Future Work
Other features that will be included, time willing, are ratings for the business that will be pulled from the Google Maps API, and hours of operation for the business. Our team will also look into the specifics of using our API for retrieving business review data from Google Maps in order to display the average rating other customers gave the business.

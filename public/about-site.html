    <h2>Minority Prince George's</h2>

    <p> Welcome to our site! Minority Prince George's is a project created by 4 
        university of Maryland students who sought to create an application that
        centralized information about PG County minority-owned businesses. 
    </p>

    <p> This endeavor hopes to facilitate easier discovery of local small 
        business owned by members of communities that are historically 
        underrepresented as business owners. Our site allows you to search for a 
        type of business, see the ratings for a given business, find out how 
        many miles away a given business is, and see the contact information for 
        a given business. 
    </p>

    <p> Check out some of the business types we can help you discover and some 
        of the communities represented on our site:
